NASA Rx-Fire: Prescribed Fire to Support Ecosystem Services (22-SMDSS22-0104)

## GEDI aboveground biomass density data
We used Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) footpint based aboveground biomass density data. Aboveground biomass density estimates have been derived applying plant functional specific model to GEDI based relative height emtics and the units of teh data are at  megagrams per hectare (Mg/ha). Please refer the full python notebook on how to get the footprint based biomass data within a user defined polygon. The GEDI biomass python code here was adapted from the notebook provided by (https://github.com/ornldaac/gedi_tutorials/blob/main/access_gedi_l4a_hyrax.ipynb).

## ECOSTRESS WUE and ESI data

## SRTM elevation data

### slope and aspect data

## Forest age data

This project used forest age data from NACP Forest Age Maps at 1-km Resolution for Canada (2004) and the U.S.A. (2006).(https://daac.ornl.gov/NACP/guides/NA_Tree_Age.html). This data set contains forest age at 1-km resolution for Canada and the United States (U.S.A.). This data set have been derived compiling data from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data, and the images from NASA’s Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project. 
Please refer the reference below for the full description of the forest age data set.
